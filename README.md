## Components

### Tools

- survey_create: Create survey with [SurveyMars](https://surveymars.com) 

## Quickstart with Claude Desktop

1. Login to your SurveyMars account from [SurveyMars Login](https://surveymars.com/app/login)
2. Get your `Account ID` and `Secret Key` from [SurveyMars Account Summary](https://surveymars.com/app/usercenter). 
3. Install `uv` (Python package manager), install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` or see the `uv` [repo](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for additional install methods.
4. Go to Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > claude_desktop_config.json to include the following:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "surveymars-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "surveymars-mcp",
        "--account-id=your-account-id",
        "--secret-key=your-secret-key"
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

If you're using Windows, you will have to enable "Developer Mode" in Claude Desktop to use the MCP server. Click "Help" in the hamburger menu at the top left and select "Enable Developer Mode".

## Example usage

Try asking Claude:

- "Help me create a German language questionnaire for a hotel satisfaction survey"
- "Create a vehicle purchase journey survey to gather valuable insights from customers at every stage of their journey, from their initial research and showroom visit, to their final purchase decision and post-sale satisfaction."

## Development

### Building and Publishing

To prepare the package for distribution:

1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:
```bash
uv sync
```

2. Build package distributions:
```bash
uv build
```

This will create source and wheel distributions in the `dist/` directory.

3. Publish to PyPI:
```bash
uv publish
```

Note: You'll need to set PyPI credentials via environment variables or command flags:
- Token: `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`
- Or username/password: `--username`/`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and `--password`/`UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`
